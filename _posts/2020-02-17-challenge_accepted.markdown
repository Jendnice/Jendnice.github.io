It’s hard to believe I’m writing the blog post for my final project at Flatiron School. The past five months went by so fast. But I think what amazes me the most is thinking about how much I’ve grown and evolved during that time. Not only have I learned a tremendous amount about Software Engineering--none of which I knew anything about prior to joining Flatiron--but I’ve also learned a ton about learning, itself. And in turn, a lot about myself.
	
I’ve always been a perfectionist. Which I’m realizing now, can be very limiting if I let it be. I remember my first call with my education coach; I told her that asking for help is really hard for me. She challenged me to intentionally ask for help over the following week and then send her a screenshot of it. I did. (I didn’t like it, but I did it.) But here’s the thing--asking for help is not only *okay*. It’s *necessary*. You know what else I’m not scared of anymore? Trying things. This might sound ridiculous, but hear me out.
	
When I first started the program, the thought of doing anything I wasn’t directly told to do terrified me. When it was time to switch from our (cozy, familiar) IDE to a (super foreign and scary!) local environment, I was legit worried. But underneath that layer-of-anxiety-in-the-face-of-change, I knew I could do it. I could dig in and learn and get it done. And, that it would be worth it. And honestly, it wasn’t that I didn’t *like* trying things...it was that trying new things scared me. What if I misunderstood the directions? What if I botched something? What if I wrecked my computer and it was completely irreversible and the whole internet broke because of *me*? (Ok, a little drastic, but you get the idea.) Obviously, I did wind up getting my local environment figured out. I had to read articles online and ask for help to get it all set. But I did it. And everyone who helped me was so unbelievably supportive. I learned a ton just through those small interactions. Plus, bonus: I *love* my local environment. It just took some extra self-encouragement to jump in and get it done.
	
Fast forward to the React-Redux project. When I wanted to integrate styling, I didn’t opt out for the easy or familiar. I didn’t waste time wondering what would happen. I dug in. I did research on Bootstrap and Semantic UI and figured out which one was the best match for me. (For this project, I chose [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/).) Furthermore, I set up a plan and supported myself. And when I hit barriers or made errors (which of course I did, because we all do), I took a deep breath and *learned from them*. And, shocker, I *love* how the styling turned out. And I can’t wait to learn more about Semantic and Bootstrap.

*Result of the Accordion component built into the user interface.*

Initially, I didn’t want to use yarn in my application. I wanted to use npm. Why? Because it was familiar. Because I knew it. Because we’d used it in the labs. So what did I do? I used yarn. A small thing? Yes, absolutely. But it’s the willingness to jump into the unknown that matters. And I’m not only doing that way more now--I’m enjoying it. I’m trusting myself to apply the knowledge I have, and learn the knowledge I haven’t acquired yet.
	
Growth mindset is a tricky little thing. But, it’s also *so* valuable. I am beyond grateful for everything I’ve learned at Flatiron. But I’m also incredibly grateful--and excited--to *keep learning*. This is just the starting platform. I have so much more to learn and do! Help to ask for...mistakes to make! And all these things will continue to support my growth as a Software Engineer, a lifelong learner, and a person. Pretty exciting.
	
 So, as far as future languages and applications--I might not know them. But I can learn them. They might not exist yet. But I can build them. And I’m ready.
