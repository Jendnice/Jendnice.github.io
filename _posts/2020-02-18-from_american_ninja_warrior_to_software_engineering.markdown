I sat in the hard, plastic chair, the back of my head thwacking slightly against its frame as I nodded out and then shot back awake again.

“He’ll likely go fast and you’re up next, so get ready,” one of the production assistants said over her shoulder. Glancing at me in my exhausted stupor her eyes softened. “Try and get up and do some jumping jacks or something.”

I did. It didn’t help.

I’d been awake for about 22 hours straight. Yet here they were, urging me up to the starting line. I could see my feet walking forward under my gaze, hear my heart pounding in my chest. Suddenly my adrenaline felt through the roof.

“Step up there, then wait for the horn, then go,” a man said waving me up onto the platform.

I was competing on American Ninja Warrior.

I’d love to say that only minutes later I was slamming my hand against the buzzer, triumphant in my epic glory. But I’d love to tell you the truth even more.

I crushed that first obstacle. I kept my cool, remembered how *I* needed to do things, being short but powerful. Cat jump, grab, balance on the edge. Jump again. Repeat. Onward. To obstacle 2. 
	
The second obstacle was the log roll. (If you’re not familiar with American Ninja Warrior, it’s pretty much what it sounds like.) I was not psyched. I’d literally watched it destroy competitors (and actually injure some) for most of the night. To say I was scared was an understatement. I was literally terrified. I marched forward.

I tucked my long braid into my tank top strap. (Because going out for your hair splashing the water would just be too ridiculous to endure.) I wrapped my arms around the log and slowly, carefully wrapped my legs. I eased my weight juuust barely over, only enough to slightly sway it towards it’s downhill ramp. My legs were too short to wrap completely around the log, so I’d hooked one foot behind the other, digging my heel in with everything I had in me.

I don’t remember when the world started spinning, just that everything was in motion. And just as quickly as that happened, I felt my heel--the one that I was so desperately digging in for purchase--slide right out of my shoe. My shoe went flying, and I followed right after. A heap of spinning limbs and blonde hair splashing into the water.

Yep, *obstacle 2*. I can’t say I’m thrilled about that. Because I’m not. But, I’m a competitor. And part of what makes me *me* is being proud of what I’ve accomplished while still continuing to push myself. They’re not mutually exclusive.

So here I am, almost five years later, and what adventure am I up to? How am I challenging myself now? Software Engineering. Yes, you read that correctly. I’m becoming a Software Engineer.

You might not see the parallels between the two, but to me it’s uncanny--I *love* solving problems. I never back down from a challenge. I enjoy being pushed, especially in ways that help mold me as a person.

So, my background--Ninja Warrior and otherwise--might not be typical for Software Engineering. Or maybe it is. Does it matter? Here’s what matters: I thoroughly enjoy the pursuit of mastery--and all the aches, pains, and lessons that come with it. And I’m ecstatic to apply that mindset to my new career goals as a Software Engineer.
