Fun fact: I used to teach Kindergarten. And one of the things I enjoyed most as a teacher was shaping knowledge into words and ideas a young learner (ie. kiddo who is five) can understand. Which, depending on the topic, can be *really*  hard. It’s also a way I’ve come to judge my own understanding of different subjects over the years...can I explain this to a Kindergartener? The better I am at doing that, the stronger grasp I feel I have on the content. So, today I’m going to give a nod to my background and a simultaneous shout-out to *The Office*. Here is: “Explain this to me like I’m five: React.js”

*React* is a JavaScript library software developers can use to create user interfaces. Well, that didn’t make a lot of sense, did it? Don’t worry--it will! Think about it like this: *React* for a *computer*, is like having a *class-subject system* in the *classroom*. Teachers can use it to create fun student activities! (Just like software developers use React to create fun websites for people!) 

So what are some of the different things we learn in school? Math, reading, writing, social studies, science. All of those are *subjects*. In React, they’re called “components.” But because we’re using our class as an example, they’re like “subjects” to us.

So these different “components” in React are like the different “subjects” in our classroom--they can be individual lessons on just certain parts of a subject, or they can be combined to build lessons where we learn more than one subject at a time.

Each subject (or component) can have what’s called *state*. *State* in a React component is like the learning goals of a lesson. For example, let’s say we have a reading lesson on syllables. That subject is *reading*, and the *learning goal* that the subject is in charge of is helping you understand whether a word has 1 or 2 syllables. Would that be the same learning goal if we were practicing counting by tens? No! Of course not! That *subject* is different--it’s math! So that subject would have its *own* learning goal. That’s like how a React component can have and be in charge of its own state!

But what happens with those lessons where we might be using information from more than one subject? For example, what if as part of our reading lesson on syllables, we were also studying the different colors of frogs? (Green. *[one clap]* Ye-llow. *[two claps]*) That sounds like science to me. And science isn’t reading, it’s a different subject! Well, just like we can “move”  or “share” helpful material from one subject area to another to enhance our learning, React components can do this, too! They use “props” (or properties) to give “knowledge” (or attributes) to other components.

Now, let’s say we’ve had our big, epic reading-and-science syllable, frog-color lesson. What happens while we’re working on that lesson? Or after? We’re *learning*. We’re gaining knowledge--maybe writing things, asking questions, investigating. All those great things that help us learn. But we need a way to *know* if we’re learning.	

React uses something called a “Virtual DOM” which is basically a big picture of what’s shown on the computer screen. For us in our classroom, that would be like having a big Learning Goal Chart for each student. And every time you work on a new lesson or in a subject, updates are made to that Learning Goal Chart. And when you’re *learning that info*, those updates are actually made in your brain! So the chart just shows us what knowledge you’re learning. The actual *learning* happens in your head! 

But a lot of times, with learning, it happens in pieces. You learn something, and then maybe you learn something else about *that*. And that helps you figure out something else about something else! We learn knowledge and then *keep building* on it. React does this, too! Just like our knowledge and learning goals get updated--or changed--as we learn, React’s components can update their *state* based on how they change!

On our Learning Goal Chart, we can also see what our learning goals look like. Guess what? *React does this, too!* React is “declarative” which is a big word that means React tells the computer program, “it should look like this” instead of “you should do this.” Our Learning Goal Chart doesn’t want to tell you how you should do something--it wants to tell you what having and using that knowledge looks like. Then you get to develop those skills and knowledge in your own 
way!

So React might seem big, scary, and confusing, but it’s a lot like how we learn in our classroom!

Alright, that’s all for now! It’s actually really tricky breaking down concepts that can seem so abstract! But hopefully the above at least helped you gain a new perspective on how complicated information can be broken down and interpreted in pieces. Class dismissed! :)
