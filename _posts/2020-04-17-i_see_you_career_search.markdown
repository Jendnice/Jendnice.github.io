You know what’s hard? Looking for a new job. Especially in a new career. As an entry-level candidate. During a global pandemic. But you know what? All good. We got this. Here’s my biggest piece of advice: start. *Just start*. The thinking, analyzing, and worrying always seems most palpable before you actually start. Don’t get me wrong, it’s important to tend to your feelings and there are ups and downs with everything. (And that’s ok!) But, in a time when it can so easily feel like you have control over nothing, you can control *when and how you start.*

For me, this means starting my *career search*. For you, maybe it’s the same or maybe it’s entirely different. Maybe it's starting a workout plan. Or implementing daily self-care habits. Whatever it is, I think a lot of the same guidelines and insights apply. Here are my tips for setting yourself up to *start*! And if you're on the same path I'm on, hopefully it'll help you achieve career search success!

**Get organized.**

Like, ruthlessly organized. This part is second nature for me. (Anyone else have multi-tiered to-do lists? Ya, I hear ya.) If it’s not second nature to you—or if you’re so fluent in planning that it backfires and hold you hostage in the prep stage instead of projecting you well-equipped into the doing stage (guilty!), then this should help. Find a tool. A notebook, an app, a wall calendar. Any combination of those and anything else that strikes your fancy. For me, I’ve tried lots of things to keep my monkey-mind on track, but I knew for my career search endeavors I wanted my “support tool” (if you will) to have a few solid features:

1.	Easily update-able for different aspects of my life (career and personal)
2.	Comprehensive enough to hold all the things
3.	Flexible enough for me to make it my own (and mirror my sometimes-crazy brain, allowing me to bestow some semblance of order amidst the chaos)
4.	Look pretty (Hey, don’t judge. That helps me. If it helps you, too, don’t be afraid to own it. You want a tool you’ll actually use.)
5.	Some aspect of interaction (Crossing items off a list, checking boxes off, etc. This ties in with the above, but it’s also an important aspect to me feel connected with my plan.)

Your must-haves may be identical to mine (hey, productivity twin!), or might be opposite. It’s all up to what works for you. Based on the above, I decided to implement [Trello](http://www.trello.com). Trello is a productivity tool that you can use to help map out ideas, projects, schedules…virtually anything. (Many companies use it for team projects and organization!) Obviously, I won’t need the team aspect of it, so some features won’t be necessary or relevant for me (assigning a card to someone), but there are tons of features that are super relevant and helpful. And hey, if I wind up wanting to assign a card to myself, or my rubber duck, or anyone else, I can!

**Start big and work your way backwards.**

I like to start big picture and then work my way back in. Otherwise 2 hours later, I’ll still be playing with detail number seventy-two of item one. So, for me, this meant thinking in broad terms—I have career goals, and I have personal goals. (Note: Some of my items are more like to-do items than goals (ex. cleaning the dishes), but for me that gets a bit semantical. Your call! Whatever works for you. I updated the verbiage to suit my needs on my individual Trello boards, but for big-picture thinking, again, I wanted to start broad.)

Then I dig in one layer deeper:
-	From Career Goals I branched down to the main targets I’m hitting weekly. Namely, making at least eight career contacts, completing five GitHub contributions, and writing 1 blog post per week.
-	From Personal Goals I branched down to my main weekly targets: training, meditating, wedding planning, cleaning, grocery shopping, etc. (You get the idea.)

**Build your (basic) plan.**

For me, the above was plenty for me to dig into Trello and start building my specific boards. You might want to get more detailed with it, or start with your largest-scope ideas. Remember, you can always move in either direction, so if you start too big and realize it, don’t worry! Just take some planning time to further or regroup your thoughts, and then dig back into your plan when you feel you have the necessary info ready.

My initial Trello boards were as follows: 
-	Career Contacts
-	Companies
-	GitHub/Tech Projects
-	Current Project
-	Blogs
-	Personal

This might seem like a lot, but it fit with how I was picturing things in mind (and how I’d mapped them in my notes), so it came together pretty easily. Also, as far as Trello goes, because you’ll basically be building “boards” and “cards” regardless of your goals, it’s pretty easy to get used to setting things up and makes the process fast.

**You have your big plan—awesome! Now, take it a bit further…**

Just like we started with big goals and backed up step by step, do the same with your boards. (Or whatever tool you’re using!) For me this is what that looked like:

Each board got columns and cards relevant to that board. Example:
a.	Blogs has three columns: Blog Ideas, In Process, and Completed
b.	Each of these columns can hold cards. So, any time I have a blog idea, I’ll create a card in the “Blog Ideas” column, with info about the idea. When that particular blog is in process, it’ll be in the….(can you guess it?)…the “In Process” column. (You’re crushing it. Give yourself a pat on the back.) Once complete, that blog card would be moved to the “Completed” column.

*Tip: One reason I love Trello for comprehensive planning is because each board can have its own structure. My “Personal” board has a completely different set up than the “Blogs” board I mentioned above. Don’t be afraid to do change things up on each board based on your needs and preferences!*

**Assess. Reassess. Adjust as needed.**

At this point I had six boards (the ones listed above), and each board had its columns and an example card in place. Some cards had additional features like labels and checklists (more on that later). So, I leaned back and admired my work. I was done. Right? Now, just onward to tackle all the things! Not quite… I realized that I had a great start, but there were some pieces missing. I starred the boards based on the ones I knew I’d be working on the most. And this uncovered a flaw in my board design: I had a “Current Tech Project” board, but only general boards for my blogs and contacts. When I sit down to do my daily work, I want to know exactly where I am for that week’s career goals: the current tech project and the current contacts and the current blog. But all I had was one of those. No sweat---easy fix! I build out two additional boards, essentially mirror what I’d done with the tech projects. So now I had eight boards. The same six as above and two additionals:
-	Current Blog
-	Current Tech Project

Then I re-starred everything in the order that I wanted to be utilizing my boards:	

*Personal, Current Contacts, Current Tech Project, Current Blog*

Followed by:

*Career Contacts, Companies, GitHub/Tech Projects, Blogs*

So now I have boards to hold my collections, as well as boards to hold my individual weekly projects and goals. One major benefit of this is that I’ll be able to maximize my use of these boards. I don’t have to create a new project board every week. Instead, I can pull one card from my GitHub/Tech Projects collective board, and copy it over (more on that later) to the Current Tech Project board. Sweet!

**Conquer all the things!**

From here it’s up to you and what works for your mind. You’ll definitely want to complete each board with the appropriate columns and cards, but remember that can be an iterative process too. You might find that you never use your “In Process” column. Or that you need two. Or something else entirely. That’s ok! Give yourself enough structure to dig in, and then allow yourself time to assess your tech tool and plan every so often to adjust things as needed. (Or be completely impatient like me and change something the moment you feel it could be better. I mean…either way!)

**Bonus!**
 
*Here are some of the nifty things I hinted at above that will make your Trello experience even more fun (and productive):*

Formatting
- Each card has a description area. I love adding notes into this area, and if you’re like me, you don’t consider them valid notes unless their formatted…well…perfectly. The shorthand to implement formatting is pretty easy to learn and get quick at, especially if you’re doing it often. Plus, Trello has a nifty link right in this area to help you format to your heart’s content. But to start you off here are two of my faves:
1. To **bold** something, use double asterisks before and after what you want bolded
2. To *italicize* something, use the underscore key. You know that single underline key? That one. (For fellow developers out there, the same key you’d use when coding something in snake_case. 😊 )

Checklists
- You can add checklists to your cards! This one is pretty straightforward: with the card you want to add a checklist to open, click on the “Checklist” button (on the righthand of the card), name it whatever you wish, and click “Add”.
- If you want to be a bit fancier, and save yourself some time, once you click “Checklist” but before you click “Add”, you can add items from another checklist by clicking “Copy Items From” and choosing from the dropdown menu. This is great when you have a checklist you want to use on multiple cards, but don’t want to have to recreate each time.

Labels
- You can add different labels to cards, which is great for designating items. For example, one way I use this is to label whether a company I’m interested in is currently hiring or not. On my Companies page, I know right away that any card that has a green label is hiring. Pretty great!
- Similar to the checklists, you can add labels to a card by opening the card. Then click on labels on the righthand side. To apply a label to your card, simply click on the label color. If you want to add a label name, click the little pencil in the label color you want to use. (For my example above, I wrote, “Currently Hiring”). Once clicked, the label color should have a checkmark, and a thin sliver of that color will then show on the top of the card, “labeling” it.

*Note: These labels will be accessible anywhere in that board. So, you can open another card in that board, click on labels and apply whichever labels you want. If you’ve already created label names, you can simply click the applicable label for that card.*

Attachments
- This is super helpful when you want your card to be more than just a to-do item. You can exactly what it says—attach things to the card. For me, I plan to use this when I want to include research I’ve done on a particular card. For example, if one of the companies I’m interested in has posted an article about their remote culture, I would add that as an attachment to that company’s card. Or for my tech projects, I often conduct research about the tech stack I want to use. Any articles or similar examples I find, I’ll attach to that project card. This makes it really easy to have all of your info where you need it. Super helpful when it’s time to dig in and focus.

Copying (and moving) cards
- (I love this feature!) You can copy any card to any column or board. Here’s how: open the card you want to copy. On the righthand side, click “Copy” and in the info that pops up, adjust any of the info as needed. (You can keep it all the same, include or remove a checklist that might be in there, change the title, etc.) *Important! — Choose the board, list, and position you want to copy your card to. *
- Here’s how this can be helpful: I generally create “Template” cards for items that I know I’ll be creating more of, and have a baseline of info I want included. (Checklist items, description parameters, etc.) Any time I create a new one of those cards, instead of starting from scratch, I open the template card and create a copy, simply renaming the copy whatever the new title is. Boom. Done. Ready to go.
- Another way this can be super epic? Remember how I have big boards for overall projects, blogs, and contacts, and then individual board for a current week’s blog, project, and contacts? The copy feature makes this seamless. Let’s say it’s the beginning of the week and I’m ready to choose a new Current Tech Project. I go my GitHub/Tech Projects board (that has the collection of project ideas) and choose one from the main ideas list. I slide this one over to the “In Process” column on that board. And, I copy that card to the Current Tech Project board. This way, I’ve updated my main page, and set myself completely up for my current project. All in the matter of, what, three—maybe four—clicks? At most? Super easy. (And really fun because, not gonna lie, it feels a bit magical.)
- Moving cards is similar to copying cards, and the process for doing so is almost identical. BUT, one important difference to note—when you move a card, the card does not stay where it is currently. It’s exactly how it sounds. Copy copies things, but leaves the original intact. Move doesn’t make a copy; it moves the original. Not a big deal if you goof this; you can always just move it back. (Ask me how I know.) But, something to keep in mind if you’re new to Trello!

**Conquer all the things!**
