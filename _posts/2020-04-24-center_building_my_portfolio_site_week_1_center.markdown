### <center> *RECONNAISSANCE* </center>

I’ve had a website for years. It started when I competed on American Ninja Warrior and was very present in the social media exercise world. I’m still training hard, but now I focus more on climbing, and strength training with occasional OCR thrown into the mix. At a certain point, it just didn’t make sense to have a website for my athletic endeavors when they’d evolved into more personal pastimes and goals than public-relative. But what I was doing a lot more publicly at that time was writing. So, I pivoted my website to be directed towards that—my writing. My website highlighted my writing, and showcased other books I loved, as well as educational activities I created based on books.

But now, here I am—a brand new, shiny developer—and whaddya know…my author website isn’t really applicable anymore. AND, (even more importantly), as a new developer, I want to build my own website. Because what better opportunity to learn more tech, practice skills, create bugs and fix them, and all the other glorious things that come with software development?!

So, this blog is the first part of a series, all about bringing my portfolio website to life. Here, at stage one, the first thing I need to do is lay the groundwork. If you’ve ready any of my other blogs, you probably know two things about me:

1. I’m a big-time planner. I plan. All. The. Things. 
2. I’m often grappling with some form of anxiety, nervousness, OCD, or imposter syndrome. (Sometimes a combination of them all.) But you know what? That’s okay. I’m sure you’ll see it surface in my writing and in my project-creation. I want to be real. But what you’ll also see is how I work through it. I want to make sure my growth as a developer is about allowing myself to learn and grow as I am. Sometimes this is messy. Sometimes it’s badass. But it’s definitely authentic. Hopefully in some way, that will help you, too. 😊

Alright, now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, here is what I’m focusing on today! In a word: reconnaissance. (Seriously, though, who doesn’t love that word?) Here is what that looks like as I brainstorm for my website...

What is the goal of my website?
* To showcase my background, abilities, and potential as a Software Engineer
* Easy ways to see my work and get in touch with me
* Should be creative, fun, and reflect my personality

K, now, with the goal in mind, what websites do I love? What do I want to emulate? (Meaning, I’m not going to look up websites for huge car companies if I know that has no correlation with a software developer’s personal website.)

*Note: Other than keeping in line with the overall goal, anything goes here—it’s simply about inspiration.*

* [http://findmatthew.com/ ](http://findmatthew.com/)
* [https://brittanychiang.com/](https://brittanychiang.com/)

Once I have at least 4 – 5 websites that are inspiring and fit with my overall goal, it’s time to dig a little deeper.

Why do I love these websites? What about them makes me happy?
* Pascal van Gemert – the colors, love the “Skills” section with star ratings, personality shows through (background pic, quote in “Abilities” section)
* Josue Espinosa – really cool graphics!! (rolling cube in intro, shape shifters further down), not too long but also maximizes the space used, very inviting interface and language (his intro, icons, etc.), unique!
* Matthew Williams – intro section is really cool (almost looks like stars moving), uses font colors to emphasize (ex. his name), love his “About” section (icons, bar graph for skills, personal and humorous “About Me”), color scheme (dark grey, bright/neon blue and magenta type pink)
* Brittany Chiang – intro is really cool (utilizes graphics and a personal logo, then loads her content), the tech vibe and style of her design (font, utilizing numbers in her sections, etc.), the side nav bars aren’t obtrusive and make important info consistently accessible (her email and social media links), colors/pics and how they change with rollovers

Now, the fun stuff…what tech is being used here? For this, I’d recommend narrowing the sites above down to one or two, just to minimized doing unnecessary research. I decided to focus my attention on Brittany Chiang’s website. (But I might revisit the others as I build mine, to work in aspects that I loved from theirs! Ah, the beauty of software development. 😊)

Alright, so, what main tech is involved here? 
* Gatsby: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/ 
* Netlify: https://www.netlify.com/ (hosting)

Now...dig in to resources on above tech!

With my ideas, inspiration, and tech support ready, the groundwork is laid! 😊 Now, I’ll dig into the resources above to make sure I’m building up my knowledge base for any new tech, and continuing to hone my skills with tech I’ve already worked with.

Up next --> wireframing my portfolio site!
