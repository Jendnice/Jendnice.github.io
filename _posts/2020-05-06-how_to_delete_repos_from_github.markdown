One thing that I’ve grown *reeeeal* accustomed to since I started programming is making mistakes. From my experience, you literally *cannot* build without making mistakes. The good news? That’s also one of the best ways to learn: to get in there, get your hands dirty, and *try something.* The other good news? You can always start over. (Ok, maybe not *always*. But most of the time!)

And, if you’re like me, that means there will be more than one occasion where that new repo you built in GitHub needs to be no-longer. And for those times, here’s a quick how-to on deleting repos from GitHub!

1.	In your GitHub account, click on the repository you wish to delete. (You can also search for it by name in the “Repositories” section of your page.)
2.	Once on your repository page, click on the “Settings” tab.
3.	Scroll all the way down to the Danger Zone. (Yes, it’s actually called this, which is awesome. It also has a red border around it, because, warning—the actions in here aren’t for play.)
4.	In the “Danger Zone”, click on the “Delete this Repository” button. And, just to reiterate, as it says on GitHub: *Once you delete a repository, there is no going back. Please be certain.*
5.	Once you click on this, you’ll see a pop-up message with another warning. (They’re not messing around, here!) And, it’ll prompt you to confirm your decision by typing in the name of the repo you wish to delete. 
6.	If you *know* you want to delete your repo, and you’ve typed in the correct name as confirmation, then, as your final step: click “I understand the consequences, delete this repository.”

Boom. Done. Your repo is officially deleted and gone from GitHub. (But hopefully the lessons learned from that particular build are not!) One thing to note—if you didn’t take a gander at the other options in the Danger Zone, it’s worth reviewing those. Besides deleting the repo, you can also:
- Make the repository private
- Transfer ownership
- Archive the repository

It’s important to think about the best way to handle your repo to achieve what you want. Deleting isn’t always the best course of action. It could be that the lessons learned in that build, (despite it going awry enough to reach delete-level), are so valuable that you want to refer back to them. Archive it! Make it private! You don’t have to delete your repo to keep your GitHub feeling shiny and clean.

Happy building! (And deleting, if necessary!) 😉
